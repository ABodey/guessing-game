    <h1>Welcome to My page</h1>
    <p>"Hello World!"</p>
    <br>
    My name is <i>Andrew Bodey</i>.
    <p>I was born in Seattle and lived there until last year. I am currently working as a mechanic at a Buick GMC
      dealership. Working with cars has been fun, and I have been fairly successful at it.  I graduated from Shoreline CC
       with an AAS in automecanics. I am the youngest of four.  I have been married to a chinese girl that I meet in
       starbucks.
